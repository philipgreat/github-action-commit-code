# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world! >> $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/file.txt

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
          cat $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/file.txt

          # The local path to the directory where your repository is located. You should use actions/checkout first to set it up
          # Default: '.'
          cwd: '.'

          # Determines the way the action fills missing author name and email. Three options are available:
          # - github_actor -> UserName <UserName@users.noreply.github.com>
          # - user_info -> Your Display Name <your-actual@email.com>

          # Default: 'Commit from GitHub Actions (name of the workflow)'
          message: 'Your commit message'

          # The flag used on the pull strategy. Use NO-PULL to avoid the action pulling at all.
          # Default: '--no-rebase'
          #pull_strategy: 'NO-PULL or --no-rebase or --no-ff or --rebase'

          # Whether to push the commit and, if any, its tags to the repo. It can also be used to set the git push arguments (see the paragraph below for more info)
          # Default: true
